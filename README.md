## 🚀 Description

During our semester of information design at the  Hogeschool van Amsterdam, [Follow the money](https://www.ftm.nl/) gave us the assignment to showcase the impoverishment of essential services in the Netherlands (in other ways than they had previously done in a published article)

This repository consists of our teams work to accomplish this goal.

## 🧩 Data

The data that was used in this project consists of:

* [cbs.json](https://github.com/Kip-Hub/ftm/blob/master/public/cbs.json)  
This file contains all the collected data on impoverishment of services over the course of multiple years in countless parts of the Netherlands. This data was supplied to us by ftm.

* [areacodes.csv](https://github.com/Kip-Hub/ftm/blob/master/public/areacodes.csv)  
This file acts as sort of a 'join' to create a link between the areacodes the cbs assigns to certain parts of the Netherlands, and their actual areacodes as they are known by the people living there.
